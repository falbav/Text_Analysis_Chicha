# Text_Analysis_Chicha
By Fabiola M. Alba Vivar
I created a code in R that uses text and sentimental analysis to analyse one of my favorite playlist: Peruvian Psychedelic Chicha

Recommended: Listen to the playlist while reading this: spotify:playlist:5owR7sSGZ0cCE8E5gsNW8x

## Data Input
I created a dataset of song's lyrics based on my -kinda famous- Spotify playlist. A little bit of context: peruvian cumbia and chicha were super popular around the 70s in Lima as a product of the huge rural-urban migration. It came back to life in the 2010s, becoming popular among young generations (like me!).
I compiled the biggest hits in this playlist.

## Some fun facts 

I selected modern and classics for this playlist, as you can see in the histogram, there is a gap from mid 80s to 2010s. 
Not surprisingly, this is also one of the worst times in Peru's history: economic and social crisis and after recovery. 
Seems like prosperity and proudness feed this music.

I also check and plotted how long are these songs. New modern songs (after 2000) are 45 seconds longer compare with the old ones in average.
