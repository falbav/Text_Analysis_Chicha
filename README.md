# Text_Analysis_Chicha
By Fabiola M. Alba Vivar

I created a code in R that uses text and sentimental analysis to analyse one of my favorite playlist: Peruvian Psychedelic Chicha

Recommended: Listen to the playlist while reading this: spotify:playlist:5owR7sSGZ0cCE8E5gsNW8x

## Data Input
I created a dataset of song's lyrics based on my -kinda famous- Spotify playlist. A little bit of context: peruvian cumbia and chicha were super popular around the 70s in Lima as a product of the huge rural-urban migration. It came back to life in the 2010s, becoming popular among young generations (like me!).
I compiled the biggest hits in this playlist.
