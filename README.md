# Text_Analysis_Chicha
I created a code in R that uses text and sentimental analysis to analyse one of my favorite playlist: Peruvian Psychedelic Chicha

Recommended: Listen to the playlist while reading this: spotify:playlist:5owR7sSGZ0cCE8E5gsNW8x

## Data Input
I created a dataset of song's lyrics based on my -kinda famous- Spotify playlist. A little bit of context: peruvian cumbia and chicha were super popular around the 70s in Lima, and it came back to life in the 2010s. I compiled the biggest hits in this playlist.
